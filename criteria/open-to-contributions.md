## Requirements

### The codebase MUST allow anyone to submit suggestions for changes to the codebase.

#### Examples

* GitHub pull requests like [https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pulls](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pulls)
* [Self-hosted Gitea pull requests](https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/pulls)
* (add a good gitlab example)

### The codebase MUST include contribution guidelines explaining what kinds of contributions are welcome and how contributors can get involved, for example in a CONTRIBUTING file.

#### Resources

* [Instructions for adding a CONTRIBUTING file on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors)

#### Examples

* [OpenZaak CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [OpenGovernment CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Git CodingGuidelines](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines) is an example of a mature codebase with extensive guidelines
* [Template for gemeente Amsterdam](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

<!-- Possible generic template here? -->

### The codebase MUST document the governance of the codebase, contributions and its community, for example in a GOVERNANCE file.

#### Examples

* [OpenRefine GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), example of a fairly mature governance structure

#### Tools

* [Simple template for GOVERNANCE file](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/supporting-codebase-governance/governance-template.html)
* The [Governance game](https://governancegame.publiccode.net/) is a tool that help communities explore their needs of governance.

#### Further reading

* [The Good Governance Initiative](https://ospo.zone/ggi/) by the OSPO Alliance has a handbook for building governance.
* [Best Practices for the Governance of Digital Public Goods](https://ash.harvard.edu/publications/best-practices-governance-digital-public-goods) by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation contains a playbook of different pracitces to implement in the governance along with case studies.
* [Organization & Structure of Open Source Software Development Initiatives](https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/files/2017/03/2017-03_governance-FINAL.pdf) by Cyberlaw Clinic has a good overview of different governance models.
* [Governance of open source software: state of the art](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10997-007-9022-9) is an academic article on governance and might be useful for someone that needs solid arguments for their decisions.

### The codebase SHOULD advertise the committed engagement of involved organizations in the development and maintenance.

#### Examples

* [OS2 Rollekatalog](https://os2.eu/produkt/os2rollekatalog) (in Danish)
* [CKAN (see the footer)](https://ckan.org/)
* [MasterPortal](https://www.masterportal.org/maintainer-group-en.html)

### The codebase SHOULD have a publicly available roadmap.

This could also be solved by having public task boards/kanban boards with suitable columns and issues/stories at high level (sometimes called Epics).

#### Examples

* [Notify roadmap](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/roadmap)
* [Simple template for technical roadmap](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/supporting-codebase-governance/technical-roadmap-template.html)

### The codebase SHOULD publish codebase activity statistics.

#### Examples

* [GitHub Insights - Contributors](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/graphs/contributors)

### Including a code of conduct for contributors in the codebase is OPTIONAL.
