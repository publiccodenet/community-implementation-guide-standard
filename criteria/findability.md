## Requirements

### The codebase MUST be findable using a search engine by description of the problem it solves in natural language.

### The codebase MUST be findable using a search engine by codebase name.

### The name of the codebase SHOULD be descriptive and free from acronyms, abbreviations, puns or organizational branding.

#### Examples

* [FixMyStreet](https://www.fixmystreet.com/)

### Maintainers SHOULD submit the codebase to relevant software catalogs.

Catalogs to consider:

* [Digital Public Goods Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/), global
* [DIAL Catalog of Digital Solutions](https://solutions.dial.community/), global
* [The Intergovernmental Software Collaborative](https://softwarecollaborative.org/), mostly USA but accepts others
* [FSF software directory listing](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page), global
* [code.europa.eu](https://code.europa.eu/), only for the institutions of the European Union
* [Inter-American Development Bank](https://code.iadb.org/en/about), mostly Latin America and the Caribbean but accepts others
* [Civic Tech Field Guide](https://directory.civictech.guide/listing-category/the-tech), focus on civic tech but has considerable overlap with public code
* [Katalog över öppen programvara inom offentlig sektor](https://offentligkod.se/), only for codebases used by Swedish public organizations
* [Developers Italia Software](https://developers.italia.it/it/software.html), Italian but accepts others
* [CodeGouv](https://code.gouv.fr/), French
* [Common Ground software products](https://componentencatalogus.commonground.nl/producten), Dutch
* [Open CoDE](https://gitlab.opencode.de/explore), German

### The codebase SHOULD have a website which describes the problem the codebase solves using the preferred jargon of different potential users of the codebase (including technologists, policy experts and managers).

### The codebase SHOULD have a unique and persistent identifier where the entry mentions the major contributors, repository location and website.

### The codebase SHOULD include a machine-readable metadata description, for example in a publiccode.yml file.

#### Tools

* [publiccode.yml web editor](https://publiccode-editor.developers.italia.it/)

#### Examples

* [OpenZaak](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/main/publiccode.yaml)
* [VerificaC19, the official Italian customization of the EU Digital COVID Certificate Verifier App for the Android Operating System](https://github.com/ministero-salute/it-dgc-verificaC19-android/blob/develop/publiccode.yml)

### A dedicated domain name for the codebase is OPTIONAL.

### Regular presentations at conferences by the community are OPTIONAL.
