Be on the lookout for people, organizations and initiatives with similar objectives to see if you can collaborate rather than compete.

## Requirements

### The codebase MUST contain documentation of its objectives, like a mission and goal statement, that is understandable by developers and designers so that they can use or contribute to the codebase.

#### Examples

* [Omgevingsbeleid objectives](https://github.com/Provincie-Zuid-Holland/Omgevingsbeleid-Frontend#objectives)
* [Vision and mission of Govdirectory](https://github.com/govdirectory/website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#direction)

#### Tools

* [Data Ethics Canvas](https://theodi2022.wpengine.com/article/the-data-ethics-canvas-2021/#1674123020653-5e9f001c-5eb8) by the Open Data Institute helps identify and manage ethical issues.
* [Ethical Explorer](https://ethicalexplorer.org/) helps navigate the future impact of technology.

### Codebase documentation SHOULD clearly describe the connections between policy objectives and codebase objectives.

#### Examples

### Documenting the objectives of the codebase for the general public is OPTIONAL.
